/**
 * Tests I want to run:
 *
 * 1. Creating a new event
 *      1.1 Succesful creation
 * 2. Updating an existing event
 *      2.1 Succesful update of title change
 *      2.2 Succesful update of date change
 * 3. Event already exists
 *
 * To simulate this, I really only have to test if it finds it as a new item or not
 * How do I simulate the oldCalendar.ics and the newCalendar.ics?
 * I also will have to maybe mock the API function calls like updateDatabaseNotino and createNotionEvent
