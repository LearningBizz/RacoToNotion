# **Reflection**

## **My motivation**

After using Notion for my university studies for a few months, I saw myself painfully adding exam and paper due dates to my main Notion calendar every few days. Therefore, I started investigating to see if this process could be automated using Notion's new API, and that's when the journey began! üö¢

## **What I learned**

-   Javascript asynchronous programming (and how the Javascript event loop works).
-   How to use Notion's API (first time using it).
-   Node.js project development (as it's the first time using node, I learned about npm and how dependencies work).
-   How to use eslint and prettierrc.
-   How and why to use `dotenv`.
